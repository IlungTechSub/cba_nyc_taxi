I would like to thank CBA for the opportunity given to work on this dataset. It has certainly challenged me intellectually. Thanks for the great questions developed by the data science team in CBA. 

Before we go deep into the answers, I would like to mention few important points as follow:
•	I used Python (Jupyter notebook) and PowerBI for the technical answers to the questions. All EDA graphs found in this document were generated in PowerBI while Python (Jupyter) is used to process the dataset and generates the majority tables found in this document.
•	Answers to the distribution questions on the ‘Basic Questions’ section, particularly question A, B, C, D and E, are using the two original datasets without any pre-processing steps. Limit was applied to some graphs due to a very long tail nature of the data.
•	Answers to question G onwards are using the sample (10%) of the population datasets. Sample is pre-processed and few outliers were removed. A sample was taken due to limited computation I possess.
•	This work was done using a limited computing I possess (16GB RAM and i5 processor). Thus, data processing and manipulation were done on a sample and few techniques that require higher computing power were not taken. Nevertheless, the steps followed and the given python code should run well with the entire population datasets should computing resources are made available. 

Tools Used:
1.	PowerBI for all EDA Graphs
2.	Python (Jupyter) for data processing and manipulation
