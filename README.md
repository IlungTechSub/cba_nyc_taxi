# cba_nyc_taxi

I would like to thank CBA for the opportunity given to work on this dataset. It has certainly challenged me intellectually. Thanks for the great questions developed by the data science team in CBA. 

Tools Used:
1.	PowerBI for all EDA Graphs
2.	Python (Jupyter) for data processing and manipulation

<b>Please go to AnswersToQuestions_ilungpranata.pdf for viewing the answers to the questions listed in the instruction. </b>

Other files:
* nyc_taxi_jupyter_ilungpranata --> this is a python jupyter notebook that contains all data statistics, preprocessing, and results
* nyc_neighborhoods.csv --> this is neighborhoods information of New York City.
* Population_EDA --> this is a PowerBI file that contains all EDA plots for the original datasets
* Sample_EDA --> this is a PowerBI file that contains all EDA plots for the sample dataset
* processed_ds/sample.csv --> it is a sample of the population used to answer some questions.

<b>Unfortunately, the Population_EDA and sample.csv files failed to upload as Github has a restriction of 100MB upload while the size of these files are way above it. These are supporting files to the answers and will only be needed if the reviewer would like to run the code or see how the plots are made. Let me know if you need them and the best way to share them.</b>
